Polish Radio
Radio Broadcasting Centre in Solec Kujawski

It is one of the most modern central transmitting stations in Europe with a output power of 1000kW, 
emitting The First Programme of the Polish Radio on long wave 225kHz frequency since 4 September 1999. 
Its range covers the whole of Poland and partly neighbouring countries and, in favourable conditions, 
further European countries.

A full solution provider of the latest generation of broadcasting equipment and antenna system
is the French company THOMCAST.

Solid-state transmitter with guaranteed energy efficiency of 88%, consists of 
three blocks and a combiner, so it is also possible to work on two blocks
with the third one under maintenance, which significantly increases the reliability of the 
emissions. 

In order to improve the efficiency of the transmitter's operation, a dynamic 
DCC carrier wave level adjustment is used.

Antenna system, with maximum radiation in the south-east direction,
consists of two quarter-wave masts with a height of 230 and 289 meters and an earthing system, 
which act as electromagnetic counterpoise. The masts are held vertically by five levels 
guying wires, made of steel ropes with a diameter of 40mm.

The high-frequency energy from the transmitter is transmitted via a wire coaxial line 
(feeder) and then via the penultimate level of guy ropes to the masts.
The highest non-insulated level of guys, galvanically connected to the ground, is the 
effective protection against lightning.

From 2015 we will start digital broadcasting of Polish Radio programmes in DAB+ standard
to the area of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.

The RCN area is 75 hectares and is sorrounded by 4.5 km long fence, 
which constituted the border zone of electromagnetic radiation.

The maximum deviation of the top of the mast in strong winds is 1.5m.
Weight of masts: 304 tons.

Time to climb to the top of the mast by well-conditioned person is: 1 hour.
